# RobGARCHBoot
Robust bootstrap forecast densities for GARCH models (Trucíos et al; 2017). 
This R package provides the forecast densitities for returns and volatilities which are usefull to obtain forecast intervals and risk measures. 
The package also provides the robust GARCH estimator of Boudt et al. (2013) using the modification proposed by Trucíos et al. (2017)
